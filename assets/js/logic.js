// This JS file should have files about games functionality


//The first view of the application displays a button to start the quiz (I guess this is already done by starter code?)


// Clicking the “Start the Quiz” button displays a series of question 

// Once the quiz begins, a countdown timer starts 

// If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer 

// The game ends when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero 

// After the game ends,  the user can save their initials and score to a high scores view using local storage 


// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score
